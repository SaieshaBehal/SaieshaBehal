## 📂 Projects

- 🎓 AI-Generated Feedback Insight Pipeline

Built an automated NLP pipeline at Equa.ls to transform large-scale unstructured user feedback into actionable product insights. Aggregated data from app stores, in-app surveys, and support tickets; performed text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization) using spaCy and NLTK. Applied LDA topic modelling and BERT-based sentiment analysis to surface key themes (e.g., notification overload, feed discovery, chatroom quality). Integrated results into interactive dashboards, enabling prioritization by both frequency and sentiment impact. Replaced manual triage, cutting analyst review time by 80% and directly informing roadmap decisions that improved user retention.

- 🗨️ NLP Tutor Quizbot

Built a gamified learning assistant using Gemini 1.5 (generation) + Claude 3.5 (evaluation).
Delivered validated, real-time quiz feedback and improved pedagogical relevance with role-based and few-shot prompting.

- 🔁 Churn Prediction: Customer Retention Optimization

Developed an end-to-end predictive churn model to identify high-risk users and guide retention strategies. Executed EDA, feature engineering, and model development using ensemble techniques (stacking, voting) in Python. Interpreted model behaviour through SHAP value analysis, feature weighting, and gradient-descent visualisation to translate predictions into actionable business insights. Improved churn recall by 18 %, enabling targeted re-engagement campaigns for at-risk customers.

- 🚚 Supply Chain Analytics: Shipment Mode Optimization
  
Designed a machine-learning model to predict the optimal shipment mode for delivering HIV health commodities in resource-limited regions. Engineered route and cost features, trained classification models, and evaluated performance using cross-validation and confusion-matrix analysis. Achieved 92 % predictive accuracy, reducing delivery delays and transportation costs, and improving supply-chain reliability for essential healthcare logistics.

- 🛒 E-Commerce Shopper Behaviour Prediction
  
Built a LightGBM-based model to forecast purchasing intent from browsing behaviour on an online retail platform. Conducted data cleaning, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning with Ridge and Lasso regularisation to mitigate overfitting. Achieved 79 % accuracy in classifying purchase likelihood, uncovering behavioural drivers such as session duration and page depth, and supporting data-driven marketing personalisation.
