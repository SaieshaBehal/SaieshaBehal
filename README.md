## 📂 Projects

- 🎓 AI-Generated Feedback QA Pipeline

Designed and delivered KEATH.AI’s first LLM QA pipeline, automating evaluation of 10K+ outputs with DeepEval (G-Eval) + GPT-4o in Python.
Built preprocessing workflows and Judge LLM prompts (CoT, persona, few-shot), validating improvements through A/B testing.
Established baseline KPIs, reframing feedback quality as a trackable product metric and surfacing systematic bias against lower-scoring students.

- 🤖 EmotiTask (iOS AI App)

Engineered a full-stack iOS productivity app with SwiftUI + FastAPI backend.
Integrated OpenAI API for MBTI-driven task recommendations and Supabase for authentication and data storage.

- 🗨️ NLP Tutor Quizbot

Built a gamified learning assistant using Gemini 1.5 (generation) + Claude 3.5 (evaluation).
Delivered validated, real-time quiz feedback and improved pedagogical relevance with role-based and few-shot prompting.

- 💬 Sentiment Analysis of Dating App Reviews

Processed 600k+ reviews with TF-IDF, VADER, and Word2Vec
Benchmarked classifiers (LogReg, SVM, Naive Bayes, FFNN), tuning FFNN to reduce overfitting and improve generalisation.

- 🚲 Data-Driven Optimization for Seoul Public Bike System

Forecasted demand with Random Forest (93.3% accuracy) for Seoul’s bike-sharing system.
Applied scenario and risk analysis, projecting a 12% efficiency gain in resource allocation.
